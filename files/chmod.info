Change access permissions, change mode.

Syntax or Usage
       chmod [Options]... Mode [,Mode]... file...

       chmod [Options]... --reference=RFile file...

Options

  -R, --recursive         change files and directories recursively

Symbolic Mode

The format of a symbolic mode is a combination of the letters +-= rwxXstugoa
Multiple symbolic operations can be given, separated by commas.

The full syntax is [ugoa...][[+-=][rwxXstugo...]...][,...] but this is explained below.

The letters 'rwx' select the permission to grant (+) or take away (-) for the affected users: 
r	Read
w	Write
x	Execute (or access for directories)

A combination of the letters ugoa controls which users' access to the file will be changed:

u	The permissions that the User who owns the file currently has for it.
g 	The permissions that other users in the file's Group have for it.
o	Permissions that Other users not in the file's group have for it.
a 	The permissions of everyone or all.

Examples
Deny execute permission to everyone:
$ chmod a-x file

Allow read permission to everyone:
$ chmod a+r file

Make a file readable and writable by the group and others:
$ chmod go+rw file

Make a shell script executable by the user/owner
$ chmod u+x myscript.sh

it is possible to use chmod with Numerical mode but it acheives the same 
goal and is covered elsewhere (man chmod)
