# nessie
nessie is an uncomplete the bash teaching monster.
This series of scripts was written to teach bash in a trial by fire sort of fashion by 
disabling lightdm and therefore dropping users to a terminal then requiring a 
series of tasks to be completed before restoring functionality.

##general outline 

### buildnessie.sh
This file takes all the files in the file directory and generates the 
static bash scripts that are used for the rest of the "game" it dynamically generates a entry in 
saveme.sh for each of the .info files  and bundles them into saveme.sh 
these scripts are then bundled into setmeup.sh

### setmeup.sh
this file is the bash script run by the unwitting participants its general goal is to 
disable lightdm which drops the participants to a command prompt on reboot (which it also does).
It also creates the files and bash scripts for the rest of the workshop and modifies /etc/motd to
inform the participants for the unleashing of nessie.

### saveme.sh
This script echo's simplified info files to the terminal it is dynamically generated by build nessie 
and includes all .info files in the file directory 
#### format of .info files
the .info files are formated such that the first line is the name of the command and a simplified one sentance description


### files/nessie.motd
is the text placed inside /etc/motd when running setmeup
