# nessie
nessie is an incomplete the bash teaching monster.
This series of scripts was written to teach bash in a trial by fire sort of fashion for the CCC workshops run on xubuntu by 
disabling lightdm and therefore dropping users to a terminal on reboot then requiring a 
series of tasks to be completed before restoring functionality.

##General Outline 

### buildnessie.sh
This file takes all the files in the file directory and generates the 
static bash scripts that are used for the rest of the "game" it dynamically generates a entry in 
saveme.sh for each of the .info files  and bundles them into saveme.sh 
these scripts are then bundled into setmeup.sh. 

### setmeup.sh
This file is the bash script run by the unwitting participants its general goal is to 
disable lightdm which drops the participants to a command prompt on reboot (which it also does).
It also creates the files and bash scripts for the rest of the workshop and modifies /etc/motd to
inform the participants for the unleashing of nessie.

### saveme.sh
This script echo's simplified info files to the terminal it is dynamically generated by build nessie 
and includes all .info files in the file directory 
##### Format of .info files
the .info files are formatted such that the first line is the name of the command and a simplified one sentance description


### files/nessie.motd
is the text placed inside /etc/motd when running setmeup.sh it is added to 
setmeup.sh when build nessie is run


originally getmeout.sh was generated by buildnessie.sh but to make the
program look more malicious on inspection they are encoded with base64
